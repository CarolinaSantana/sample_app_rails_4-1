# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). You can use this reference implementation to help track down errors if you end up having trouble with code in the tutorial. In particular, as a first debugging check I suggest getting the test suite to pass on your local machine:

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app_rails_4.git
    cd sample_app_rails_4
    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
    bundle install --without production
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
    bundle exec rspec spec/

If the tests don't pass, it means there may be something wrong with your system. If they do pass, then you can debug your code by comparing it with the reference implementation.

## Adapting sample application to a service model implemented with Docker containers

The main idea is deploy the next structure, automatically:
 
![alt tag](https://github.com/carmelocuenca/csantana_project/blob/master/tfm_doc/images/figures/iteration1.png?raw=true)

From this repository, the Docker image of the application, *sample_app_rails_4_image*, is built. Then, the Docker container, *some-postgres*, that refers to the database is created. The Docker volume, *volume-public*, allows you to have a shared space between the application Docker container and the *some-nginx* Docker container, that represent the web proxy. Thus, the container of the application is composed of a first executable Docker container, *app-job*, that creates, migrates and populates the database and for other Docker container, *app-task*, that will be running with the web server puma launched.


First, to get this you need to export the PostgreSQL user and password environment variables to the main directory:

    $ . ~/.postgres/credentials

Then, you can do the deployment of the discussed infraestructure by running the following script:

    $ ./docker-microservices.sh
    
## Adapting sample application to continuos Integration and Deploy with Travis CI

The main idea is deploy the next structure, automatically:
 
![alt tag](https://github.com/carmelocuenca/csantana_project/blob/master/tfm_doc/images/figures/iteration2.png?raw=true)

First you need to create an account, unless you already have it.

Then you can use the travis configuration example and add your encrypted credentials:

    $ cp .travis.yml.sample .travis.yml
    $ travis encrypt DOCKER_USERNAME=************ --add
    $ travis encrypt DOCKER_PASSWORD=************ --add

You can also specify the email in which you want to receive failure or success messages about the pull in *recipients*.

Every time there is a change with a *commit* and you upload it, *push*, to the repository the integration takes place. In order to integrate and consolidate the changes automatically the new image of the repository is built and pulled to Docker Hub.
